# We use fork because of video call crash
# https://github.com/denis15yo/webrtc/commit/c75f2a397ec3c7db12677b39b52d2b3f8ee9161e
# When merging with the telegram code, we can try using the original repository 
# and check if the crash (pressing the video button during the call) is fixed.
# Perhaps the crash is related to the minimum version of iOS (we have iOS 14, telegram has iOS 12).
